Here's a sample README.md for your Stock Market Simulation Game project:

Stock Market Simulation Game
Overview
This is an interactive Stock Market Simulation Game developed using C++, utilizing advanced algorithms such as Dynamic Programming (DP), Fenwick Trees, and Monotonic Stacks for maximum profit calculation. The game allows users to buy and sell stocks, manage their portfolios, and track transaction histories.

The game simulates real-time stock pricing and enables users to make intelligent decisions based on the maximum profit they can achieve using different algorithms.

Features
Dynamic Stock Pricing: Real-time stock prices that fluctuate during the game.
User Registration & Transaction: Users can register, buy, and sell stocks.
Profit Calculation Algorithms:
Dynamic Programming for maximum profit calculation.
Fenwick Trees for efficient range queries and updates.
Monotonic Stacks to maximize profit in an optimal time complexity.
Portfolio Tracking: Users can track their transaction history and manage their portfolio effectively.
Console Interface: A user-friendly console interface to interact with the game.
Algorithms Used
Dynamic Programming (DP): Used to find the maximum profit by calculating the difference between the minimum and maximum stock prices.
Fenwick Tree: A data structure used for efficient range queries and updates to calculate maximum profit.
Monotonic Stack: Used to calculate the best stock buy and sell points in O(n) time.
Technologies
C++
Fenwick Trees
Dynamic Programming
Monotonic Stacks
How to Play
Register User: Upon starting the game, you can create a user account.
Buy Stocks: Users can buy stocks at dynamic prices.
Sell Stocks: Sell stocks at the price they were bought.
Profit Calculation: The game uses various algorithms to calculate the best time to buy and sell for maximum profit.
View Portfolio: Users can view their stock portfolio and transaction history.
